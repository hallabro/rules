# Rules

If you think something needs to be re-defined, please forks this repo and send a PR and we will review it. There is a current restriction of 160 characters so take that in mind!

1. **Be kind and respectful.** - This will all be way more fun if everyone is nice to each other. You can disagree on something while not making it personal.

2. **Stick to the topic in posts.** - This is a community for Software Engineering. For anything else, please post in another appropriate community.

3. **No ads/self-promotions/promotions.** - Promote meaningful content, not products. Our rule: No ads, self-promo, or other kinds of promotions in this community. Exceptions are OSS/FOSS projects.

4. **No posts with links to content that is hard to access.** - Everyone should be able to access the content without any restriction and without websites with annoying popups.

5. **No general career advice.** - Any career advice post must contain questions and/or discussions that notably benefit from the participation of aspiring or professional software engineers.

6. **No spamming.** - Don't spam with the same content over and over. Also don't respond to a post with a quote in a new post. Spam will result in ban.

7. **No memes.** - Although we love memes, we want to have a community of serious discourse. Find another appropriate community for memes.

8. **No posts in languages other than English.** - The only language that should be used here is English. And that includes links to resources as well.

9. **No low-effort posts.** - For example, no posts with bare links/reposts without containing any additional and insightful comment/description.
